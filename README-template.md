## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Netlify


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

This is my first full project with React.js, it made me practice more about useState, useContext and learned me how to structure an React app. I've also learned how to create a Drag and Drop and to deploy with Netlify.
```

### Continued development

I still need to practice more with useContext, but also perfect my CSS especially with the resizing of the page. I need also to actually practice doing web page for mobil. I also need to learn how to use local storage or connect the app to a database directly.
